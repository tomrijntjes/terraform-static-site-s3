# Minimal static site on s3 with terraform

With terraform one could automate 90% of the [Setting up a Static Website Using a Custom Domain Example](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/website-hosting-custom-domain-walkthrough.html) from Amazon

As far as I'm aware, domain name registration is not supported, so do so first. 
1. Go to [Route53](https://console.aws.amazon.com/route53/home) and register a domain
2. Go to Hosted Zones, locate the autogenerated hosted zone and copy the Hosted Zone ID
3. intstall terraform & clone this repo
4. `terraform init`
5. `terraform import aws_route53_zone.zone YOUR_HOSTED_ZONE_ID`
6. `terraform apply`
